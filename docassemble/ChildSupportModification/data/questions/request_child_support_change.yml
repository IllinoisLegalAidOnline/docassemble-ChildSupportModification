  UPDATE THIS PAGE
  
  To use this program you will need to know: 

  * Your court case information, 
  * What you want the court to do,
  * Names and addresses of the other parties, and 
  * Names and addresses of the other parties’ lawyers, if any. 

  You can find most of this information on other court papers you have about this case.

  After you finish this program
subquestion: |
  UPDATE
  
  After you download your *Motion*, you must file it with the court. This program **does not file** your *Motion* for you.
  
  You may need to schedule a court date for when the judge will hear your motion. The scheduling process is different depending on your location and case type. Check with your local circuit clerk for how to schedule a motion hearing.
  
  Finally, you will need to send your *Motion* and *Notice of Court Date for Motion* forms to other parties in your case, if there are any.
  
  To learn more, read the instructions you can download at the end of this program.
